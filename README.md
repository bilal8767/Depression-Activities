# Depression-Activities
This Project is about taking readings of different subjects at different activities and on the basis of that measure the depression level of subjects. Activities like Sitting, Walking, Standing , Eating and Jogging are measured with the help of Bangle JS. Bangle JS is programmable watch. Espurino IDE is used to program the watch. Then Different Machine Learning models are applied to check whether which model suits best and then test the data on this model. 

This project focuses on predicting the depression activities of participants—specifically identifying whether individuals are depressed or not depressed—using machine learning techniques. Data was collected through a Bangle.js smartwatch, which records various physical activities such as running, standing, walking, sitting, and eating. The smartwatch was programmed and managed using the Espruino IDE, enabling the extraction of activity data with corresponding timestamps through the terminal.

In addition to the collected data, an open-source dataset named Sense Motion was utilized to enhance the training and evaluation process. Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree, were implemented and compared based on their performance metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among these, the Decision Tree achieved the best overall performance. Consequently, this model was employed to train the custom dataset collected from the Bangle.js device. The trained model successfully classified participants as depressed or likely not depressed, demonstrating the potential of wearable devices and machine learning in supporting early detection of mental health conditions.
